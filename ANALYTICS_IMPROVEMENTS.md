# Analytics Improvements Update

## Summary
Enhanced the Analytics view with state persistence and improved calculation accuracy for better insights into event tracking patterns.

## New Features

### 1. **State Persistence**
- Selected event type is now saved and restored between app sessions
- Time range selection (Week/Month/Year) is also persisted
- Uses `@AppStorage` for automatic UserDefaults synchronization
- No more re-selecting your favorite event type every time!

### 2. **Improved Average Calculations**
- **Daily Average**: Now correctly calculates inclusive date ranges
  - Counts from the first event date to today (inclusive)
  - Example: 10 events over 5 days = 2.0 per day (not 2.5)
- **Weekly Average**: Derived from daily average × 7
  - More accurate than dividing by week count
  - Handles partial weeks correctly

### 3. **Better Trend Analysis**
- Compares last 2 weeks vs. previous 2 weeks
- Uses daily averages for fair comparison
- Percentage-based thresholds:
  - **Increasing**: >20% growth
  - **Decreasing**: >20% decline
  - **Stable**: Between -20% and +20%
- Handles edge cases (no previous period data)

## Technical Details

### State Persistence Implementation
```swift
@AppStorage("analyticsSelectedEventTypeId") private var savedEventTypeId: String = ""
@AppStorage("analyticsTimeRange") private var savedTimeRangeRaw: String = TimeRange.month.rawValue
```

### Accurate Date Calculations
```swift
// Calculate inclusive days
let startOfFirstDay = calendar.startOfDay(for: firstEvent.timestamp)
let startOfToday = calendar.startOfDay(for: now)
let daysBetween = calendar.dateComponents([.day], from: startOfFirstDay, to: startOfToday).day ?? 0
let totalDays = daysBetween + 1 // Include both start and end days
```

### Trend Calculation Logic
```swift
// Calculate daily averages for each period
let recentDailyAvg = Double(recentEvents.count) / 14.0
let previousDailyAvg = Double(previousEvents.count) / 14.0

// Calculate percentage change
let percentageChange = ((recentDailyAvg - previousDailyAvg) / previousDailyAvg) * 100
```

## User Benefits

### Persistence
- **Convenience**: Your analytics preferences are remembered
- **Continuity**: Pick up where you left off
- **Efficiency**: No need to navigate to your most-used event type

### Accuracy
- **True Averages**: Daily averages reflect actual usage patterns
- **Fair Comparisons**: Trend analysis uses consistent time periods
- **Meaningful Insights**: Percentage-based trends are easier to understand

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Exercise Tracking
- First event: January 1st
- Today: January 10th
- Total events: 5
- **Correct calculation**: 5 events ÷ 10 days = 0.5/day
- **Weekly average**: 0.5 × 7 = 3.5/week

### Scenario 2: Trend Analysis
- Last 2 weeks: 14 events (1.0/day)
- Previous 2 weeks: 10 events (0.71/day)
- **Change**: +40% increase
- **Result**: Shows "Up" trend

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create events across different date ranges
2. Verify averages match expected calculations
3. Test trend detection with various patterns
4. Close and reopen app to test persistence
5. Switch between event types and time ranges
