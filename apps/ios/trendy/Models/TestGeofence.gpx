    Geofence Testing GPX File
    
    Instructions:
    1. Replace the lat/lon values with coordinates near your geofence
    2. The first waypoint should be OUTSIDE your geofence
    3. The second waypoint should be INSIDE your geofence
    4. The third waypoint should be OUTSIDE again (to trigger exit)
    
    To use:
    1. Run your app on device via Xcode
    2. Go to Debug menu → Simulate Location → TestGeofence
    3. Watch the console for geofence entry/exit logs
