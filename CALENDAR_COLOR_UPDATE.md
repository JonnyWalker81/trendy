# Calendar Event Colors Update

## Summary
Updated the quarter and year calendar views to display actual event type colors instead of generic blue dots, making it easier to identify different types of events at a glance.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Event Type Colors in Compact Views**
- Each event now shows with its assigned event type color
- Up to 3 event type colors displayed per day
- Maintains visual consistency with month view

### 2. **Improved Visual Design**
- Small colored dots (4x4 pixels) for each event type
- Horizontal layout shows multiple event types
- White border on dots for "today" to ensure visibility
- "+N" badge when more than 3 event types on a day

### 3. **Event Type Grouping**
- Events are grouped by type to avoid duplicate colors
- Sorted alphabetically for consistent display
- Shows unique event types only (no duplicates)

## Visual Examples

### Day Display Logic
- **No events**: Just the day number
- **1-3 event types**: Colored dots below day number
- **4+ event types**: First 3 dots plus "+N" badge
- **Today**: Blue circle background with white-bordered event dots

### Color Benefits
- **Quick identification**: See event types without zooming in
- **Pattern recognition**: Spot recurring event types across months
- **Visual consistency**: Same colors used throughout the app
- **Better planning**: Identify busy periods by event type

## Technical Implementation

### Event Type Filtering
```swift
private func eventTypes(on date: Date) -> [EventType] {
    // Get all events for the date
    // Extract unique event types
    // Return sorted array
}
```

### Compact Day View
- Shows up to 3 event type colors
- Each dot is 4x4 pixels with 1px spacing
- Positioned below the day number
- White border for visibility on "today"

## User Experience Benefits

1. **At-a-glance information**: Instantly see what types of events occur when
2. **Color-coded patterns**: Recognize work days (blue), medical appointments (red), exercise (green), etc.
3. **Reduced cognitive load**: No need to remember what blue dots mean
4. **Better planning**: See distribution of event types across time
5. **Consistent experience**: Same color system as detailed views

## Performance
- Efficient event type deduplication
- Minimal UI elements per day
- Smooth scrolling maintained
- No impact on app performance
