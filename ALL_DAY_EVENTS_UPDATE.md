# All-Day Events Support Update

## Summary
Added full support for all-day events in the Trendy app, both for viewing existing events and importing from the iOS Calendar app.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Event Model Update** (Event.swift)
- Added `isAllDay: Bool` property (default: false)
- Added `endDate: Date?` property for multi-day events
- Updated initializer to include these new properties

### 2. **Calendar Import** (CalendarImportManager.swift)
- Removed filter that excluded all-day events (line 117-119)
- Now imports all events including all-day events

### 3. **Import Process** (CalendarImportView.swift)
- Updated event creation to include `isAllDay` and `endDate` properties
- All-day events are now properly imported with their metadata

### 4. **Event Display** (EventRowView.swift)
- Added conditional display logic for all-day events
- Shows "All day" instead of time for all-day events
- Regular events continue to show hour:minute format

### 5. **Calendar View Logic** (EventStore.swift)
- Updated `events(on:)` method to properly handle all-day events
- Multi-day all-day events now appear on all applicable days
- All-day events are sorted first in the daily event list

## Features

### All-Day Event Handling
1. **Single-day all-day events**: Display on their specific date
2. **Multi-day all-day events**: Display on all days within their duration
3. **Sorting**: All-day events appear before timed events in lists

### Visual Presentation
- Calendar view shows all-day events with event type indicators
- List view displays "All day" text instead of time
- Selected date view shows all-day events at the top

## User Experience

### Import Flow
- Users can now import all-day events from their iOS Calendar
- Birthday events, holidays, and other all-day events are included
- Multi-day events (like vacations) are properly handled

### Display
- Clear "All day" label distinguishes from timed events
- Consistent display across all views (Calendar, List, Details)
- Proper sorting ensures all-day events are prominent

## Technical Implementation

### Date Handling
```swift
// For all-day events spanning multiple days
if let endDate = event.endDate {
    return date >= calendar.startOfDay(for: event.timestamp) && 
           date <= calendar.startOfDay(for: endDate)
}
```

### Import Mapping
```swift
Event(
    timestamp: calendarEvent.startDate,
    eventType: eventType,
    notes: calendarEvent.notes,
    sourceType: .imported,
    externalId: calendarEvent.eventIdentifier,
    originalTitle: calendarEvent.title,
    isAllDay: calendarEvent.isAllDay,  // New
    endDate: calendarEvent.endDate      // New
)
```

## Benefits
1. **Complete Calendar Import**: No longer excludes all-day events
2. **Better Event Tracking**: Support for vacation days, holidays, birthdays
3. **Accurate Calendar View**: Multi-day events appear on all relevant days
4. **Clear Visual Distinction**: Users can easily identify all-day vs timed events

## Testing Recommendations
1. Import calendar with various all-day events:
   - Single-day (birthdays, holidays)
   - Multi-day (vacations, conferences)
   - Recurring all-day events
2. Verify display in:
   - Calendar view (event dots on all applicable days)
   - List view ("All day" label)
   - Event details
3. Create manual all-day events (future enhancement)
